Please install package in backend and frontend berfore run the system
- backend is in the root folder
- frontend is inside root folder (ex: ```chat-socket/frontend```)
- goto root folder (```chat-socket/shop-app```): ```pnpm add .``` or use your package manager.
- open frontend folder ```/frontend```(```cd frontend```): ```pnpm add .``` .
- run system 

I exposed the .env file on purpose so you can use the app easily. But if you want to reconfigure the setting, feel free to change the .env file.

chat-socket is made using MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node), Socket and Typescript
